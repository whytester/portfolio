Hi , I’m Graeme, a Wordpress Web Developer based in Bristol , UK. 

For the last 8 years I’ve worked with the London based agency PoweredByCoffee to help build and maintain wordpress sites for a diverse range of clients including a small book stockist, an online degree info portal and a site dedicated to leadership and professional growth in the tech industry.

My role has been as diverse as the client base, examples of recent daily tasks include debugging front-end issues with an Elementor site, plugin development to help de-index thousands of old low traffic content pages and block development ( new blocks and extending core block functionality )

I’ve transitioned from float to flex, Gulp to Webpack, SCSS to theme.json, and from ACF to custom fields updated via React-built blocks. I am eager to continue evolving my skill set and embracing new technologies.

**Examples of some my current clients:**
