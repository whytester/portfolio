Hi , I’m Graeme, a Wordpress Web Developer based in Bristol , UK. 

For the last 8 years I’ve worked with the London based agency PoweredByCoffee to help build and maintain wordpress sites for a diverse range of clients including a small book stockist, an online degree info portal and a site dedicated to leadership and professional growth in the tech industry.

My role has been as diverse as the client base, examples of recent daily tasks include debugging front-end issues with an Elementor site, plugin development to help de-index thousands of old low traffic content pages and block development ( new blocks and extending core block functionality )

I’ve transitioned from float to flex, Gulp to Webpack, SCSS to theme.json, and from ACF to custom fields updated via React-built blocks. I am eager to continue evolving my skill set and embracing new technologies.

**Examples of some my current clients:**

**Futurelearn**
[futurelearn.com/info](https://futurelearn.com/info)
*The info portal for a multinational online-degree system from leading universities.*

Tasked with supporting the client site while helping refactor old legacy php code, updating their asset build system while providing regular support and SEO assistance from page speed improvement to de-indexing content.

**Beekeeper**
[beekeeper.io/](https://www.beekeeper.io/)
*The info portal promoting Beekeeper’s software platform designed to streamline team communication and collaboration in the workplace.*

Responsible primarily for improving their editorial capabilities working in a small team developing content blocks and maintenance/support of the site.

**MyFamilyTravels**
[myfamilytravels.com](https://myfamilytravels.com/)
*A US based family travel resource hub offering tips, destination guides, and travel news.*

Maintain the site, helping debug issues from legacy code and build out pages to assist with SEO , from author pages to de-indexing low traffic content, handling tag manager additions and general code refactoring.

**Leaddev**
[Leaddev.com](https://Leaddev.com)
*LeadDev is a platform focused on supporting engineering leaders through insightful content, conferences, and events. It provides a space for senior engineering professionals to engage with the latest industry trends, best practices, and leadership strategies.*

Working as part of a small development team to build a clean, modern WordPress theme for content migrated from Drupal. We utilized the latest WordPress technologies, including theme.json to minimize CSS enqueues and Gutenberg blocks for flexible content management. I served as the primary support contact for daily issues, attended weekly client meetings, and participated in daily team standups. Our team followed a structured process using PRs for code reviews and task management handled by productive.

A recent example of block development can be viewed at the top of [this event page](https://leaddev.com/leaddev-london/).  The animated header block was created so the client could use the library provided by https://www.finisher.co/lab/header/ while still able to use standard inner child elements overlaying the canvas animation generated by finisher.co.  The code is available [here](https://github.com/whytester/portfolio/tree/main/blocks/AnimatedHeader)
